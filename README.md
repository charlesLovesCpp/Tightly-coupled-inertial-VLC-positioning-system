Abstract: Recently, it is believed that visible light communication (VLC) will take the lead in future indoor communication system as the popularization of high power LEDs. By taking advantages of VLC, many visible light positioning (VLP) algorithms emerged, however most of them required at least three visible LEDs and therefore can not cope with intermittent LED availability, under which fewer LEDs will be presented in image. To handle such a challenging condition, we propose a tightly-coupled inertial/visible-light positioning system with a visual-inertial sensor. Experimental results show that the proposed system not only achieves median location and orientation errors of 0.98 cm and 2.35$^{\circ}$ respectively with four visible LEDs, but also performs well with presence of intermittent LED availability.
